# Google-Earth-Engine-and-icebergs
This code uses ArcticDEM version 3 2-meter strip data to automatically detect icebergs in Google Earth Engine (GEE)

To be able to use this graphical user interface (GUI) and generate a dataset of icebergs, a user needs to ensure they have a GEE account (free for individual license). If you do not have an account yet, you can register for one here: https://earthengine.google.com/new_signup/. The authentication process could take a few days to approve the license.

This tool was designed to allow users with no coding ability to generate their own dataset of icebergs. All the user needs to do to attain this dataset is define a region of interest (ROI) and click a few buttons for the data to export to their Google Drive!

Below is a quick run through of how best to use the GUI and attain the data which is required. 

The GUI can be found here: https://code.earthengine.google.com/f38494aa9f268cf807cdefe8c107783e 

Using the tool

Once the GUI is accessed through the link above, the GEE broswer will open up as shown below (and click 'New Project'):

A new project has now started so you can now navigate to your glacier of choice (in this example we are using KNS on the southwest coast of Greenland). Draw your ROI before clicking 'OK':
